# SmoothSend: Gasless USDC Transfers on Aptos

## 🚀 What is SmoothSend?

SmoothSend is a revolutionary Web3 application that allows users to send USDC (stablecoin) on the Aptos blockchain **without needing to pay gas fees**. Users can send money instantly and for free, while SmoothSend handles all the technical complexity behind the scenes.

## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

Traditional blockchain transactions require two things:
1. **The token you want to send** (e.g., USDC)
2. **Gas fees** (paid in the native token, APT on Aptos)

This creates a barrier for new users who might have USDC but no APT for gas fees. SmoothSend eliminates this friction.

## ✨ How It Works

### For Users:
1. **Connect Wallet**: Connect your Aptos wallet (Petra, Martian, etc.)
2. **Enter Details**: Specify recipient address and USDC amount
3. **Sign Transaction**: Sign the transaction (no gas fee required)
4. **Instant Transfer**: USDC is sent immediately to the recipient

### Behind the Scenes:
1. **Smart Contract**: User signs a gasless transaction
2. **Relayer Service**: Our backend service picks up the transaction
3. **Gas Sponsorship**: We pay the gas fees using our relayer wallet
4. **Fee Collection**: A small service fee is deducted from the USDC transfer
5. **Execution**: Transaction is executed on the Aptos blockchain
