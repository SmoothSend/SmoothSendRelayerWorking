```move
// Add to your contract:
const MAX_DAILY_VOLUME: u64 = 1000 * 1_000_000; // 1000 USDC
const MAX_USER_DAILY: u64 = 100 * 1_000_000;   // 100 USDC per user
const EMERGENCY_PAUSE: bool = false;
```

### 2. Community Involvement ($500-2000)
- Post on r/aptos, Discord, Twitter for code review
- Offer small bug bounties
- Partner with other DeFi projects for cross-review

### 3. Monitoring & Analytics (Free)
